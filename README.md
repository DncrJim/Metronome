## Metronome

Project for Code Louisville Android Spring 2019

I am constantly frustrated by how complicated most metronome apps are, how long they take to load, and that their color scheme is much to bright to use in a dark gig. This app is written to address these issues.

This app is written in Kotlin, and
The framework for a quick loading metronome app.
Written in Kotlin, uses Room to manage a persistent database of previously entered tempo.

Loads and sorts most recently used tempo.
